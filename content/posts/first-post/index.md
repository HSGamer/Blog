Welcome to my blog.

This is where I'll express my interests in various topics. I'll go from casual topics (Life, Styles, Hobbies, Games, etc.) to advanced and academic ones that are in my fields (Programming Languages, Development, Software, Technology, Hacks, etc.).

This is purely to create a formal way to communicate my thoughts and receive opinions from you guys to make some kinds of constructive debate.

Also, this website is a part of my open-source project that can be found in [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/HSGamer/hsgamer.github.io). Therefore, the content here is transparent and open to modify.

See you soon in future posts, and have fun.
